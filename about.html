    <div class="about-body">
      <p>Welcome to The Blackpool Dispatch — a personal blog about the things I think about, argue about, and care about. That means politics, the communities I'm part of, the town I call home, and the culture that keeps me going.</p>

      <p>I'm based in Blackpool, and I write from that perspective. Not as a journalist, not as an expert — just as someone paying attention. I've watched this town be talked about, written about, and used as a symbol for decades. I'd rather write <em>from</em> it.</p>

      <h2>Politics</h2>
      <p>I have views. I'm not going to pretend otherwise. I think about class, about power, about what it means to live in a place that gets used as a political prop. I try to be honest about my biases and rigorous in my arguments. I don't always get it right, but I try.</p>

      <h2>Music & Wrestling</h2>
      <p>Two of the great loves of my life. Music has been with me since I was a kid — I grew up on the edges of the northern rave scene, then fell sideways into indie, folk, and everything in between. I write about gigs, records, venues, and why live music matters.</p>

      <p>Wrestling — specifically British wrestling — is something I've followed for years. I love the storytelling, the spectacle, the athleticism, and the community around it. I'll write about indie shows, big events, and the history of the sport.</p>

      <h2>Community</h2>
      <p>This is where a lot of my writing lives. I believe in community. In neighbours looking out for each other. In the unglamorous, unsung work of people who make places function. When I write about housing, about food banks, about local services — this is where it comes from.</p>

      <p style="margin-top: 2em; font-style: italic; opacity: 0.6;">Thanks for reading. All opinions here are my own.</p>
