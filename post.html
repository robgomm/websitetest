    <h1>The North is Not Your Backdrop: Why Blackpool Deserves Better Than Promises</h1>

  <article class="post-body">
    <p>Every election cycle, without fail, they come. Politicians in high-vis jackets standing in front of derelict buildings, promising transformation. Regeneration. Investment. The phrase <em>levelling up</em> was practically invented for places like Blackpool — and yet here we are.</p>

    <p>I've lived on the Fylde Coast long enough to watch this pantomime repeat itself. The cameras arrive, the promises are made, and then the next news cycle sweeps it all away. The buildings stay derelict. The services stay underfunded. And the people who live here — who were never consulted, only photographed — carry on.</p>

    <blockquote>
      The problem isn't that politicians don't care about Blackpool. The problem is that they only care about Blackpool when it's useful to them.
    </blockquote>

    <p>This isn't a piece about despair. I've read enough of those. This is about accountability — and about what it would actually mean for a government to take northern coastal towns seriously, rather than treating them as convenient symbols of decline.</p>

    <h2>What "Levelling Up" Looked Like Here</h2>

    <p>Let's be concrete. The levelling up agenda under the previous government produced, for Blackpool: some road resurfacing, a culture fund that benefited the already-functioning Winter Gardens, and a great deal of ministerial activity on social media. Meanwhile, child poverty rates in parts of the town remain among the highest in England. The high street continues its long retreat.</p>

    <p>I'm not here to argue that nothing has improved — some things genuinely have. The new tram extension was long overdue and welcome. Some of the regeneration work around the town centre has real potential. But the gap between the rhetoric and the reality is wide enough to drive a campaign bus through.</p>

    <h2>What We Actually Need</h2>

    <p>People in Blackpool don't need to be saved. They need investment that serves them, not investors. They need mental health services, not more glossy reports about mental health services. They need secure, affordable housing — not the short-term holiday let churn that hollows out communities and turns neighbours into strangers.</p>

    <p>They need politicians who will come here when the cameras aren't rolling. Who will sit in community meetings and listen. Who understand that regenerating a place is not the same as renovating a seafront hotel.</p>

    <p>Until that changes, the north will continue to be a backdrop — a visual shorthand for problems that other people are going to solve. And the people who live here will continue to wait.</p>

    <p>I'm not waiting quietly.</p>
